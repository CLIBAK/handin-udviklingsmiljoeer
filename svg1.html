              <h3>What is a viewbox?</h3>
              <p>The viewBox attribute defines the position and dimension, in user space, of an SVG viewport.<br>The value of the viewBox attribute is a list of four numbers: min-x, min-y, width and height.  </p>
              <h3>What is a viewport?</h3>
              <p>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.<br>The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.</p>
              <h3>How do they relate to each other?</h3>
              <p>The viewport is like a window you look through to see an SVG's content.<br> The viewBox is similar to the viewport, but you can also use it to “pan” and “zoom” like a telescope.<br> Control the viewport via width and height parameters on the svg element. Control the viewBox by adding the attribute viewBox to the svg element</p>
              <h3>How to scale an SVG drawing's appearance on a web page?</h3>
              <p>To specify the coordinates within the SVG image independently of the scaled size of the image, <br>use the viewBox attribute on the SVG element to define what the bounding box of the image is in the coordinate system of the image, <br>and use the width and height attributes to define what the width or height are with respect to the containing page.</p>
